Question 7 (10 % ~ 30 min) - Mockito
------------------------------------
This question is about unit testing and test isolation.

Your job is to write unit tests for a LoginService. The LoginService collaborates with
a UserDAO (an object that retrieves a User from the database) and the retrieved User. 
This is a typical workflow:
   1. The client asks the LoginService if isAuthenticated("someUserName", "somePassword")
   2. The LoginService then in turn tells the UserDAO to findUserByUserName("someUserName")
   3. If the user exists, the LoginService gets a User in return and asks the User if
         passwordMatches("somePassword")
   4. If the user exists and the password matches, the user is authenticated. Otherwise, 
      the user is not authenticated.
      
Use the mockito framework to obtain test isolation for the LoginService. Also, use a 
@Before-method to do all the setup to make the test methods as lean/focused as possible. 
You can assume that a UserDAO can be injected into the LoginService by setter-injection. 
Write 4 tests that verifies that:
 - anExistingUserWithMatchingPasswordShouldBeAuthenticated
 - anExistingUserWithNonMatchingPasswordShouldNotBeAuthenticated
 - loginServiceShouldTellUserDAOToFindUserByUserName
 - loginServiceShouldAskFoundUserIfPasswordMatches
