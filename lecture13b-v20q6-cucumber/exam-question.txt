Question 6 (13% - 40 min) - BDD and Cucumber
--------------------------------------------
“Cucumber is a testing tool that supports Behaviour Driven Development (BDD).”

We want to build a web store application. One of the requirements is that a user
should be able to put items in a shopping cart while browsing the store. 
The shopping cart should keep track of the number of each selected item (5 bananas), 
calculate subtotals for each item (the total for the 5 bananas), and calculate the 
total for the cart.

Suggest how a tool like Cucumber can be utilized in the development of this requirement.
Write a sample Cucumber test for the shopping cart requirement for one feature with 
one scenario written in Gherkin, and with step-definitions written in Java. You should 
explain choices made in how Cucumber communicate with the underlying application.
